# 📘 DocumentDB Developer Course

Welcome to the **DocumentDB Developer Course** — a hands-on walkthrough designed to teach developers how to build, query, scale, and expose PostgreSQL-based JSON document stores using Microsoft DocumentDB.

By the end of this course, you’ll have:
- Built and loaded a structured JSONB dataset
- Learned to query and update JSON documents
- Run real analytics and built visual dashboards
- Created a lightweight API for your data

Perfect for:
- Backend engineers
- Data explorers
- SQL users curious about NoSQL-style modeling
