# üìà Module 6: Visualizing Your Data in DocumentDB

Welcome to Module 6. You‚Äôve structured and queried your data‚Äînow it‚Äôs time to visualize it. In this module, you‚Äôll learn how to connect your DocumentDB data to a dashboard tool for exploring orders, revenue, and trends in real time.

We‚Äôll cover:
- Tools you can use (Metabase, Superset, etc.)
- Connecting PostgreSQL to a dashboard tool
- Building charts from JSONB fields

---

## üõ† Recommended Tools
All of these support PostgreSQL out of the box:
- [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/)
- [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/)
- [Redash](https://redash.io/)

We‚Äôll use **Metabase** for this walkthrough.

---

## üîå Step 1: Connect Metabase to DocumentDB
1. Install Metabase (Docker or standalone)
2. Launch it and go through the setup
3. Add a new **PostgreSQL** database:
   - Host: `localhost`
   - Port: `9712` (if using the default from earlier modules)
   - DB Name: `postgres`
   - User/Pass: your setup credentials

---

## üìä Step 2: Explore a Table
- Go to **Browse Data** ‚Üí Select your `ecommerce_orders` table
- Click **Summarize**
- Start with a simple metric: average `total` across all orders

---

## üì¶ Step 3: Build Visuals from JSONB
Metabase supports raw SQL queries.

### Total revenue by status:
```sql
SELECT order_data->>'status' AS status,
       SUM((order_data->>'total')::numeric) AS revenue
FROM ecommerce_orders
GROUP BY order_data->>'status';
```

Visualize this as a **bar chart** or **donut chart**.

---

## üß† Try This
- Count of orders per day using `shippedAt`
- Top 5 most frequently ordered products
- Average order value per user

---

## ‚úÖ Up Next: Creating an API
In Module 7, you‚Äôll build a lightweight API to query and serve your JSONB data to the outside world.
